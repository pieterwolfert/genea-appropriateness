# genea-appropriateness
Scripts to run Barnard's test on JSON output from the appropriateness study of GENEA 2022.

Steps to reproduce GENEA 2022 results:
- run app_analysis.py with the corresponding JSON output from the HEMVIP system
- run app_analysis_multi.py with the CSV file from the first script as input. This will calculate Barnard's test. This takes a while to process.
